# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL

In Data Analysis, the data quality and cleanliness are more important.
In this Data Cleaning project,I clean the housing data by altering the Date values and separated the Address column by State and City, Populate the null values for the columns and deleting the duplicated values and dropping the unused columns.
